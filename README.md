# Go-experiments

This repository just holds a few experiments with Go.  
Some are plain and simple, some are more complex.  
My goal is to preserve some things that I have learned about the language.

### Content

- **asymptotic-complexity**: Compares O(1) operations in map vs slice
- **decorator-pattern**: Having an interface call itself
- **lookup-table**: Compares a map access vs switch-case for performance
